        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Joseph Nguyen, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for crafting user-friendly
          web applications and innovative software solutions. My current goal is to aspire others and create applications
          that people could use with ease. Another side goal of mine is to create a game or several games that everyone else and I could enjoy.
          I specialize in C++, C#, Java and front-end languages like HTML and CSS. Currently learning Javascript to widen my skills.
          My hobbies are watching Anime, playing video games, and playing volleyball. 
          I want to create applications that I can enjoy coding and also for users to enjoy using them.
